TESTIMONIALS.

From Chanes Anthou, LL.D.‚ ,say-Professor ‘ff Lan·
{35:1⁸⁹ Columbia Collega, and Rector qs tlte Gramma?

Ar the request of Mr. Reynolds, I have examined the
manuscript of a Latin Biography of Washington, by the
late Mr. Glass‚ of Ohio, and consider it well worthy of
publication. It is, indeed, quite a curiosity os its kind.
There is generally an air os stiffness in the productione
of modern Latinists‚ which soon betrays a want of fa-
miliarity‚ on the part os the writer, with the idiom em·
ployed by him. Nothing of this nature is to be discov-
ered in the present work; on the contrary, the most cur-
sory reader cannot fail to be struck with the easy flow
of the style, and the gracefnl turn of very many os the peri·
oda. The care, too, which has been exercised in the se-
lection of appropriate terms and phrases is worthy of
notice, especially when taken in connexion with the fact
of the author's having written his work without the aid
os any books os reference. and his having been compel-
led, consequently, to rely solely on the stores os his own
memory. 1 would not wish to be understood as viewing
this productiori in the light of an accurately critical and
finished piece, but yet Ι cannot help thinking that it will
make a very good school-book. For the subject will in-
terest the young scholar, and awaken the best feelings in
his bosom; while, is the Latinity os the work should at
any time appear to the instructer os a questionable or er-
roneous character, he can consult the improvement of
his pupils, and at the same time display his own acumen.

in suggesting other and better expressions.
