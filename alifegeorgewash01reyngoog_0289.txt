Μι. Eunomo,
Dua snm—ln compliance with your request, I have

examined “A Life os Washington‚ in Latin Prose‚ by
Francis GlasS, A. M„ of Ohio.” My opinion of this pcr-
formance is, that in purity of style, rotundity of period,
and judicious selection of words, it is exceeded by none
of the modern works introductor-y to the study of tho
ancient Roman classice. Its imperfectione arc few; its
beauties numerous. It will be a valuable acquisition to
our classico] schools‚ initiator-y to Coesar or Nepos, or
such first Roman author as the toacher may see causo to
adopt. Such an American book has hitherto been a de-
sidentum. It is now furnished. It is well calculated
to fito tho youthful genum, and inspiro the genereus mind
with tho pumat patfiotic sentiments.

In thus exproseing mysolf, Ι cannot help mingling
tomo feeling with my recollectione of tho author. I was
acquaintod with Mr. Glass from his boyish days. He
was an enthusiastic votary of the classic muso immedi-
ately on his initiation into the Grammar School. That
he labourod not in vain, this production will be a lasting
memorial. .
