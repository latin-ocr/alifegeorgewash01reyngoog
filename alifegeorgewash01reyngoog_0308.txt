bach's bombat-da, for a canneru Milton’s globulus, sor a.
buttem or Grotius’ σαρίἱωπωιεωπ, for a wig. As a spe-,-
cimen of Mr. G.’s Latinity, we subjoin an extract from
the work. It is Judge Marshall‘s announcement in Con-
gress of the death of Washington.

The “ barbarisms” of Mr. Glass. are always so well in
accordance with the genius of Latin deciension, as never-
ιο appear at variance with the spirit os the language‚ or
out of place in their respective situations, His “equiv-
alents,'’ too, are, in all cases, ingeniously managed: and
we are mistaken if the same can be said of the ‘⁶ equiv··
alents” of Erasmus—certainly not of those used by Gro-
tius, or Addison‚ or Schroeckh, or Buchanan, neither of
whom is scrupulous in introducing words from which a
modern one is deduced, in the exact sense of the Bag-2
Βοὴ analogous term, although that term may have been
greatly perverted from its original meaning.

Proca, by Francis Glass, A. Μ., os Ohio‚” edited by J..
N. Reynolds, and look upon it as a work of merit, evim.
cing more than ordinary classical attainments in the·

correct, the words of great purity, and the peculiarity of
the Latin idiom being preserved with great purity through-
out. It presente numerous exemplos of the happy trans·-
lation of modern ideas, words, and phrases, ‘into the
ancient lang-uage. It might be a valuable addition to.
the private library of the student of Latin, inducing him,
by the interest of the subject and style, to a voluntary
pei-usal of works in that ancient language3 and it might
be read extempore before the instructor with advantage,
