TESTIUONIALS.

nised as not Athenian, by the over-strictness of their Attic
Greek, by the stiff precision, the ornate redundancy‚ and
the servile imitation os ancient models. Not content
with being well acquainted with the language, the eom-
posers os scholastic Latin have for the most part applied
themselves to copy word for word, and sentence for sen-
tence, the style os this or that Roman author. Every
phrase was modelled upon the shape of the phrase oc-
cupying a similar position in the work of Livy or Tacitus,
Sallust or Cicer0; so that the entire work has been
rather a cento of some old author, a thing of shreds and
paternos, than an original composition.

Widely different from this is the Life of Washington,
by Francis Glass—he has written with a full mind, with
a soul fraught of old with the treasures of Roman lore ,
not writing his Latin sentences accurately because any
one had so written his sentences before him ; but because
the style of the dead language flowed as steely and in as
pure a stream from his garnished spirit, as would his
periods in the vernacular. It is this which gives its
great charm to his curious work ; not that it is merely ,cor-
τοοκ, but that it is naturally so: not that the English
idioma are elegantly transferred into another tongue‚ but
that the writer actually thought in Latin. This it is
which rendere it the only modern Latin composition
worthy to be set as a school-book before learners——that
whatever they leam therefrom will be as just and pure
as though it had been drawn fresh from the fountain-
head. This it is which gives us hope, that, written as it
is in the universal longae, the one language current among
the scientific and the polished from Buenos· Ayres to Ice-
land, from the islands of the Paciflc to the shoresos the
Atlantic, it may become a text-book and a standing history
in other hemispheres—that it may be studied by mysti-
cizing metaphysical Germana in Gottingen or Leipsi03'
that it may be mused over by the Spanish Creole of
Mexico or Paraguay; that it may inspire the hyperborean
Russ with the ardent love of liberty, and teach to the
volatile Gaul stability and firmness, bv the noble example
of the most equable and constant-minded man, the firm·
