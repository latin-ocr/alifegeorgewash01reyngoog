memorial o'f intellectual superiority, that chance
may throw in our way, and, more particularly so,
those productione which reflect honor on our native
genius„ The literature of a nation is not to be
built up like a modern edifice, with suitable honors,

and design, small things, as well as gre‘at,in it's
foundation. “ “ “ ’ ’

· ing to return to college to pursue my studies, in

the winter ξ but circumstances, unnecessary for
me to state, prevented' me from joining my- class at

‘that time, and 1 was induced to seek, in the west'ern η

part of the state, a person with whom 1· could

. ‘prosecute my studies duringthe winter season. l
