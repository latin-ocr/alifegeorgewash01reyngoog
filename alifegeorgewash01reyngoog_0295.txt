of what geniu- end labour, unaided end unencouraged,
cen eccomplieh, is trnly a θαμ tle-ea. But thie work ie
not merely interesting ae a curiosity. It ie written with
eurprieing accurecy, and really poeeeeeee no common
portion of the ease, spirit, and racinees of classical com·

position. Mr. Reynolds deservee well of hie country for
hie attempt to introduce it into our schoole ae a book of
elementary instruction. It ie not only quite equal, in
point os Latinity, to many of the works of modern echol-
ατε which ere already in use for that purpose, but its sub-
ject will give it a far higher interest for American youth,
while it serves to keep before their minda the example of
thet ‘⁴ augunt end immortal man,” the spirit of whose his-
tory will do scarcely leee to preserve the libertiee of his
country, then the wiedom os the institutione which he hae
boqueathed her.

1 cannot conclude thie notice without alluding to the
effectionate end eloquent tribute which Mr, Reynolds hae
peid to the memory of hie friend and instruerer, in the
introductory memoir, and which, from ite tendency to
cherieh a generoue love of classical etudieS, contributes

not a little, in my opinion, to the charm and velue of the

work. J. PROUDFIT

Dua Suu—I heve examined Mr. Glaes'e Life os Waeh·
ington in Latin, and have formed a very favourable opin-
ion of ite general merite. 'I'hough the work hae some
desecte, yet these are trifling when compared with its
excellences; end many perte display a purity of style,
sufficient to rank the author very high in the scale os
medem Latin writers, It will be pemsed with interest
end utility by the youthful mind, and deservee to find n
place in the librnry of the classical scholar.
