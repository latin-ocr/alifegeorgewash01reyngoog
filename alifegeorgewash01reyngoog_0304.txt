est patriot and the purest conqueror, that ever led a host
to glory, or sheathed the sword in honourable sels-deny-
mg peace.

It should be indeed a source of honest and patriotie
exultation to every trueborn American, to think that, by
the zealous exertions of an obscure, an humble, and un-
known individual, the fame of his country’s brightest
ornament may be spread from one extremity of the
civilized world to the other: that it may do so is our
earnest wish; and, as a first step towards this end, we
strenuously advise its immediate adoption as a class-
book in all our district schools‚ anii should further be in»-
clined to advocate its admission into the higher institu-
tions sor the dissemination of learning. In recommend-
ing this work so strongly to the public, and especially to.
the instructers and guardians of youth, we are fully
borne out by the strongly-expressed opinions, to the same
effect as curs, of the best and ripest scholare of our
country, which will be found appended to the text.

From the New- York American.

A mre of Washington, written in pure, flowing, easy,
and ,classical Latin, by a country schoolmaster in onio,
whose life was passed in teaching the children of his
country neighbours to read and write, is certainly a. re-
markable productiori. The circumstances under which
it was composed, together with the manner in which the
editor, Mr. Reynold3‚ became acquainted with the author,
are told in amost interesting manner in Mt. R.'s preface‚
from which we make no apology for extracting largely.

The interest of this story may justly add to that of the
work it ushers forth3 and when it is said that Professor
Anthou of Columbia College‚ Professor Patton of the
New·York University, Professor Wylie of the University
of Pennsylvania, and other approved scholam, bear wit-
ness to the purity of the style in which it is written, it is
not an unreasonable hope to express, that this life of
Washington may become an elementary class-book in our

Latin schools. U
