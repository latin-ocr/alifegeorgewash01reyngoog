11· is with no smpll satisfficuon we announce to our
leaders the appearance of this work3 because it cannot
fail to produce the happiest effecte upon the rising gener-
ation‚ when introduced into our schools as a class-book,
which it undoubtedly wiu be. A life of Washington in
Latin is indeed peculiarly appropriate on many accounts.
Whose deeds more worthy of its lofty diction! Whose
virtues more deserving of its majestic simplicity'! What
Roman could boast of a life 80 pure ‘i-of patriotism 80
disinterested3 It is well to place in the hands of our
youth this record of the Father of his country, in the
same language in which they read of the valour of Caesar,
of the prudence of Fabius, and the virtues of Cincinna-
tus; for it will enable them, with a glow of honest pride,
to feel that in Washington all these rare and exalted at·
tributes were combined. Nor will it be less gratifying
to them to know, that in the wilds of Ohio a ‘⁴ Gla-effi has
been found to hold up to the world an imperishable image
of him who has been emphatically and truly pronounced
to be the ‘⁴ first in war, first in peace, and first in the beart·
of his countrymen.”

Of its Latinity and style it would in become us to spealr,
since sufficient proof accompsnics the work, in the certifi-
cstes annexed to it, of many of our professore, who bear
ample testimony to its purity, its beauty, md its force.

From the Now-York Time&

Tmo, if it be not the best, is the most extraordinary
book of the day. As a specimen of pure Latinity‚ ιι has
been pronounced by the best scholare in the country to
be a singularly correct and beautiful productiori. It
comes before the public in a manner which should com-
mend it to its kindest attention; and if, as we have every
reason to believe, it is a specimen of Latinity as pure as
it is unnmnmon, there can be no doubt that it will bo gen-
erally adopted by our 80110018 and seminaries of learning.
We shall again allude to this extraordinary productiong
and in the meantime we commend it to- the attention of
the scholare of eur country.
