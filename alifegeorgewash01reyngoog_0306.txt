From tlte Seuthem Literni-y Messenger sor Dec„ 1835.

W: may truly say that not for years have we taken up·
a volume with which we have been eo highly gratified, aa
with the one now before ua. Α Life of Washington,
succinet in form, yet in matter sufficiently comprehensive,
has been long a desideratum: but a Life of Washington,
precisely euch as a compendious lise of that great man
thould be—-written by 8 citizen of Ohio—and written, too,
in Latin, which is not one jot inferior to the Latin of
ErasmuS, ie, to say, the least of it, a novelty.

We confess that we regarded the first announcement⁵
of this rara avis with an evil and suspicione eye. The
thing was improbable, we thought. Mr. Reynolds was
quizzing us--the brothers Harpe: were hoaxed-—and
Messieurs Anthon and Co. were mistaken. At all events, ·
we had made up our minds to be especially severe upon
Mr. 81853, and to put no saith in that species of classica]
Latin which should emanata from the backwoods os Ohio.
We now solemnly make 8 recantation os our preconceived
opinions, and eo proceed immediately to do penance for
our unbelief. ε

Mr. Reynolds is entitled to the thanks os his country·
men for his instrumentality in bringing this book before
the public. It has already done wonders in the cause of
the classi083 and we are false prophete if it do not ulti-
mately prove the means of atirring up to a new life and
a regenerated energy that love of the learned tongues
which is the surest protection of our own vernacular lan-
guage from impurity‚ but which, we are grieved to see, is
in a languishing and dying condition in the land.

We have read Mr. Res preface with great attention;
and meeting with it, as we have done, among 8 multipli-
city of worldly concerno and every-day matters and oc-
currence3‚ it will long romain impreseed upon our minda
ae an episode os the pur-est romanoe. We have no diffi-
culty in entering fully with Mr. Reynolds into his kindly
feelings towards Mr. Glass. We perceive at once that
we could have loved and reverenced the man. His im·
age ie engraven upon our fancy. Indeed‚ we behold him
