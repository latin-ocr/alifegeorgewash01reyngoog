From Professor Ingraham, qs Mississippi.
Now-York, July 25, 18³6.

Sur-1 have just complotsd an attentivo and critical
porussl of tho Life os Washington in tho Lstin hugusgo,
from the pen of Francis Glass‚ ednod, and recently pub-
lishcd by yourself. As s literary enterpriso this novel
production is deserving of tho highest commendatius.
Aithough in some degree open ιο criticum, the narrative
is perspicuous—tho langusgo strong and elegant, and tho
Intinity remarkably chasto. But whatever may be tho
ssults of stylo or idiom. tho shafts of criticism sto turned
asido, while we pauso to do homage ιο th'o genius of tho
ιιιιιι and tho erudition os the scholar. The author hss
laid the foundation for s now era in modern biographical
history, upon which future scholars will ercet nn imper·
ishable superstructum to the memorias of tho good and

great os our country.
And in what langusgo can we so δοθιιίιιςΙγ embolin

the actions of distinguished Americsns ss in the majestic
periodo of the Roman 3

Tho introduction οῖ this modern classic into tho
schools and univorsities of tho United states, must bo
productiva of great morsi and intellectus] bencfit to Amer-
csn youths. Early taught, through its pagos, and in tho
sublimest of human languagss, the principles of truc
greatness, patriotism, and political liberty—iuuetrated by
the life and actions of the distinguished subject of this
biogmphy-thcy will transfer the veneratiou with which
they revers the manes of the great men of· antiquity to tho
august shado of the Fathet of their Country; and that
haio of glory with which young scholam, in all ages, bave
loved ιο encir010 tho heroes of Grooce and Rome, will
hei-castet, with a brighter and moro hallowcd lustro, sur-

tound the memory of Wsshington
