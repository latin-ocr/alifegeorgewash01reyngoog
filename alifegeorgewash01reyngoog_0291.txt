1 nm satisfied that this work, from the excellence of

its style, and its rich materiale of biography and history,

will become a popular and valuable elementary book in
our schools. Severe criticism may detect some ‘⁶ Pata-

it was written, Ι consider it an extraordinary productiori.

From tlte Rev. John Maclean, Vice-President and Profes-
sor qt' Ancient Languages and Literature qs the coz-
lege of Nem-Jersey.

Tun Life of Washington, by Francis GlasS, is, in the
opinion of the subscribet, a work os singular merit, and of
that degree os excellence which is claimed sor it by the
editor 3 who, by its publication, has discharged a just debt
of gratitudo to his able preceptor.

An unqualifled approval is not claimed for the work,
nor is it the design of the subscriber to give it such a
one. His engagements, during the time it has been in
his hands‚·have not admitted of his examining the entire
work, yet he doubts not that a pei-usal of the whole would
serve only to deepen the favour-able impressione already
received.

The handsome manner in which the work is presented
to the public, reflecte great credit upon all concerned in
its publication.

Itis to be hoped that the youth of our country may
become familiar with this productiori of a ripe scholam
and that they may leam to emulate the author's ardourin

the study of the ancient classice.
