ranunculum.

parison strikes the spectator much as if, for a personificn·
tion of poetry‚ a fac-simile of Alexander Pope should be
set bv the side of the Apollo Belvidere. Such are my
comparisons between ancient and modern eloquence.
But then Ῑ am told that we can resort to translations sor
all the spirit of ancient composition. If all the young
men of our country could be taught to read and under-
stand your Life of Washington, and then to read a page
of Livy, Sallust. or Tacitus, and afterward endure ο,
translation, it would be time to burn up all the classice.
1 should be sorry to lose them, and therefore hope your ο
Life of Washington may be extensively read.

1 am with much respect, sir,

Your obedient servant,
' J. Q. ADAMS.

University of Nuhville, Dec. utb, 18³5.

Dua Sin. -1 duly received your favour of Augu-t
zoth, together with a copy of the Life of Washington‚ by
the late Mr. Glass, · for which, plene accept my hemy
thnnka.

1 fully concur in the very favourable opinion of its ex-
traordinary merite expressed by Professor Anthou of
Columbia College.1 have, on all suiteble occasions,
spoken of the work in such terme es to induce at least
a few of my acquaintance to purchase it. Our book·
sollers, at my instance, keep a supply on hand. I have
recommended it in the newspapers as an excellent text-
book for the classical school and academy z and Ι believe
our toacher-s are about to introduce it accordingly. 1
will cheerfully do all in my power to extend its circula-
tion in this part of the country.

Ι heve the honour to be, dear sir,
Very respectfully‚
Your most obedient servant,
PHILIP LINDSLEY.
