ΜΣ· Dum Sm,—1 have been slew in expreseing an
opinion of your Glass's Life qs Washington, not from in·
difference to its merite, but because 1 have thought it
deserving of a more eereful end critical reading than 1
et first intended to give it. It is not only a literary curios-
ity. but in truth a work os rere merit. We have been so
little accustomed to look for werke of this kind among
ourselvee, end eo much in the habit of depending upon
the Germane for our preliminary Latin books, that even
our nationel vanity does not prevent ue from the exercise
os exemplary cantion and scrutiny before we seriouely
talk of introducing American Latin into our schools. 1
hazard the opinion, however, that, while we all agree that
the finish end ripeness of classical scholarehip can only
be atteined by e patient end long-continued etudy of the
classic moach, Glaes's [ase of Waslzington will be found,
oven in point of Latinity, to deservo e place in the pre·
ecribed course of studies preparatur-y to our collegee,
end 1 shall rejoice to see it holding the position which it
merite in our beet Latin schools and academice through-
out the country.

Ι remain, eir, with sincere respect,
Your friend end servent,
· CHAUNCEY COLTON.
