mTIROMAH·

nono—nt this very moment——with all his oddities and ap-
pertenancee about him. We behold the low log cabin

of a schoolhouse—the clapboard roos but indifferently

tight—-the heles, ycleped windows, covered with oiled
paper to keep out the air—the benchee of hewn timber

smck fast in the ground—the etove, the dealt, the urchinS,
and the Professor. We can hear the worthy pedagogue‘e
classical ‘⁶ Salvas? and our ears are still tingling with hie
hyperclassical exhortatione. In truth, he was a man after
our own beart, and, were we not Alexander, we should
have luxuriated in being Glaes. .

A word οι· two respecting the Latinity of the book.
We sincerely think that it hae been underrated. While
we agree with Mr. Reynolde, for whose opinions. gen-
erally, we have a high respect, that the work can boaet
os none of those elegances of diction, no rich display
os those beauties and greces which adorn the peges of
some modern Latiniste, we think he has forgotten, in his
search after the mere flowere of Latinity‚ the peculiar na-
ture of that labour in which Mr. Glass has been employ-
ed. Simplicity ltere was the most reasonable, and indeed
the only admissible eleg-anco. And if this be taken into
consideration, we really can call to mind, at this moment,
no modern Latin composition whatever much superior to
the Washingtonii Vita of Mr. Glaes.

The clothing os modern ideas in a language dead for
centur-ies, is a task 'whose difficulty can never be sully
appreciated by those who have never undertaken it. The
various changes and modificatione which, since the Au-
gustan age, have come to pass in the sciences of war and
legislation especially, must render any attempt similar to
that which we are now criticising one of the most haz-
ardous and awkward imaginable. But we cannot help
thinking that our author has succeeded ὰ merveille. His
. ingenuity 18 not 1888 remarkable than his grammatical
skill. Indeed, h'e is never at a 1088. It 18 noneense to
laugh at his calling Quakers Tremebundi. wermbundi is
as good Latin as (l'rernentes, and more euphonical Latin
than Quackeri—sor both which latter expressions we have
the authority of Schroeckhz and glandes plumbea, for.
