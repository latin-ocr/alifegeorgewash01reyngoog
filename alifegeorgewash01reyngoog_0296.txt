Latin School, Boston. ”

J. N. Burcana, Eae.

Dua Srm—-At your requeet I have examined‚ with ae
much attention ae my time would admit, the Life of
Washingtom in Latin Proee, by Francis Glass of Obie-4
edited by you.

The attempt you have mad( to give something os a
national character to our school classice, is a good one.
As a specimen of modern Latinity‚ the volume is highly
creditable. The notes are ae they should be‚—-simple,
and not eo numerous as to render the student'e task too
easy. Ι εὶιομὶά be glad to see it introduced as an ele·
mentary book into our school& .

Respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
cH. K. DILLAWAY.

Dua διας-Ι have examined a portion of the Life of

Washington, in Latin Prose, all that my· other avocatione
would permit. 1 have been much pleased with the per-
formance‚ and, with a discriminating instructa, it must
prove a good work for scholare, in the early part of their
Latin course. I hope it will be generally introduced in
au our good school&
1 am, very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,

Dua Sm‚-1 have examined the Latin Life of Wash-

ington with as much care as my time would allow, and
must confess myself in general pleased with its execu-

His verbal order is certainly very praiseworthy3 it ie
